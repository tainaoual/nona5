# Class Completion
#### Module 1 - Week 2

## Assignment Instructions
Uncomment the tests in the `SavingsAccountTest` one at a time, sequentially.
Start at the top of the test class and work your way down one test at a time.
These tests will drive out the creation of a `SavingsAccount` class.

If all the tests pass you will have built a `SavingsAccount` class that has the following features:
 - A starting balance
 - An account number
 - The ability to add money to the account
 - The ability to withdraw money from the account
 - The ability to add interest to the account balance.  (This is a super bank account and accrues interest whenever you call the method to accrue interest!)
 - Not fulfilling a withdraw if the withdraw would put the balance below 0.
 
## Deadline and Grading Criteria
The deadline for this project is Monday, September 21st, at 9:30am.
If the project is not complete or not pushed up to GitHub at that time it will be evaluated as an _Incomplete_ project.

This is a Pass/Fail assignment, the assignment will be considered passing if it meets the following criteria:
- Uses Git and GitHub to push complete assignment to GitHub before due date.
- The code compiles.  (No red squiggly underlines!)
- All unit tests pass as they were originally written. (Please don't change the unit tests that we have provided)

If your project doesn't meet these criteria at the deadline, it will be marked as _Needs Improvement_.

If your project is evaluated as _Incomplete_ or _Needs Improvement_ we will let you know and give you feed back on what needs to change to help move it to a passing project.
You will receive a new deadline of Friday, September 25th, at 9:30 to re-submit your project by pushing changes to GitHub.  
We will evaluate the project one more time and record this as the final grade for this project with _Incompletes_ and _Needs Improvements_ being set to _Fail_ on the _Pass/Fail_ scale.
